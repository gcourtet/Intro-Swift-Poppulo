# Introduction to iOS app development using Swift

The purpose of this session is to introduce you to the basics of Swift and to show you how easy it is to code your own iOS app. I am not an expert in the language neither am I in app development but I'll try to share with you some of my experience.

## How today's session is going to be ?

I want to make this as interactive as possible so I will usually start by showing you some stuff and then we will be trying to apply what we just saw.

If you have any question, feel free to ask them and I will do my best to provide an answer !

## Getting ready

Nothing in particular is needed, just make sure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed. Then make sure to copy the project repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gcourtet/Intro-Swift-Poppulo.git
cd Intro-Swift-Poppulo
```

Every step that we are going to go through today will refer to a new branch in the repository. So in order to make sure that you have the same code as the one I'll be using, please use :
```shell
git checkout step-<# of the current step>
```

## Step 1 : let's play with a Playground

There are several ways of starting to use Swift. A fun way to get familiar with the language is to play around in a Playground. Let me first show you what does Swift look like.

Now, please go to the branch corresponding to step 1 :
```shell
git checkout step-1
```

As I've just shown you, if you were to create a new Playground, you would have to click on ```"Getting started with a playground"``` after opening Xcode. However we are going to work on a Playground that has already been modified...

Your job here is to complete the code for the Point class.

## Step 2 : solutions

If you want to check the solution (my solution) for the code you can just checkout to branch step-2.
```shell
git checkout step-2
```
If you don't care because you're a beast you can just wait for the next step.

## Step 3 : our first app !

We are now going to create our first app. Don't expect it to be a million dollar app. We are going to start slowly in order to make you more comfortable with the Xcode environment, the tools and how they work.
```shell
git checkout step-3
```

## Step 4 : now let's have fun !!!

Great job lads, you've created your first (basic) iOS app ! Now that you are a little bit more familiar with how things work we are going to go further and build a more complicated app, using the MVC pattern.
```shell
git checkout step-4
```

## Steps 5-... : your turn to learn !

That's all for today folks, I hope that this little session has taught you something and that you are now eager to try and see what you can do on your own. The best way to actually learn how to create apps using Swift is to watch videos and read tutorials. Some of my favorites places to teach myself are :
* [Stanford iOS class](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsJq-VuSo2k26duIWzNjXztkZ7VrbppkT) : amazing youtube playlist with a great teacher,
* [Ray Wanderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com) : cool website with plenty of tutorials,
* [Brian Advent](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCysEngjfeIYapEER9K8aikw) : cool youtube channels with nice tutorials,
* [Jared Davidson](https://www.youtube.com/user/Archetapp) : another cool youtube channel with great tutorials.
